# Developer Portfolio

The developer portfolio is a fun project as we will use some skills outside of CSS, including AI image generation and creating mockups of smartphones to contain our projects using Photoshop templates. The project code itself will be a great way to showcase our knowledge of CSS Grid, Houdini, color palettes, transitions, animations, and responsive design. We will use this project also to learn how we can optimize our media to improve our websiteâ€™s performance.
